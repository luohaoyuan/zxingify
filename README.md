# zxingify

[![Build status](https://api.travis-ci.org/zxingify/zxingify.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/zxingify/zxingify)

A Swift Port of ZXing.

The primary goal is to replace ZXingObjC with a complete Swift port of ZXing.

During this time, ZXingObjC will be fully supported and maintained.

We try to stick as much as possible to the original ZXing code, to ease the maintenance path for porting stuff from one project to another.
